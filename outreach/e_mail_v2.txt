Subject: Exploring AI-driven workflow automation

Hi {company_name} team,

This first message was prepared with the help of an AI assistant,
under human supervision.

I’m currently working as a freelance automation specialist,
helping organizations design and deploy AI-assisted workflows
(local systems, human-in-the-loop, no black boxes).

I came across your company while testing an AI-based prospecting pipeline,
and I wanted to check whether this topic could be relevant in your context.

This is not a mass outreach and there is no obligation.
If automation or internal efficiency is something you are exploring,
I’d be glad to continue the conversation myself.

Best regards,  
Romain
